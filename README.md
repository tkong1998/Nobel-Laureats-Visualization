# P5: Putting it All Together

<b>Due Date</b>: April 22, 2019

<b>TODO</b>:  
1. Select one dataset among the five;
2. Design & implement an interactive visualization of the data.


<b>Important</b>:
1. You do not need to use every attribute included in the data set. It is up to you to select which attributes you want to include to make an effective visualization. We would prefer, however, that you do utilize all the data cases in your visualization;</br>
2. For visualizations that are more about analysis and exploration, remember the analytic tasks that we have been discussing all semester. Make sure your visualization supports many of them. If you are doing more of a storytelling visualization, then think about the aspects of the data and “messages” that you want to communicate.
